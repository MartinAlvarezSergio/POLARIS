# POLARIS (POLArized RadIation Simulator)

is a 3D Monte Carlo continuum radiative transfer code.

- Simulate intensity and polarization of light emerging from analytical astrophysical models as well as complex magneto-hydrodynamic simulations on various grids

- Perform dust heating, -emission, -scattering, -grain alignment, line radiative transfer, and synchrotron simulations

- Calculate synthetic intensity and polarization maps

- Make use of a full set of physical quantities (density, temperature, velocity, magnetic field distribution, and dust grain properties as well as different sources of radiation) as input

For installation, please take a look in our *quickstart.pdf*.
